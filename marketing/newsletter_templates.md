## Template 1: Weekly Tips Roundup

**Subject line:** 3 hygiene tips you're probably missing

**Preview text:** Quick habits that make a difference

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

This week's top-voted hygiene tips from the community:

**1. The 20-second rule for hand sanitizer**
Most people just smear sanitizer and move on. But to actually kill germs, you need to cover ALL surfaces - between fingers, under nails, back of hands, wrists - for a full 20 seconds. If your hands are dirty or greasy, sanitizer won't work. Soap and water are required first.

**2. Why your pillowcase matters more than you think**
Pillowcases accumulate dead skin, oils, bacteria, hair products, and night cream every night. If you have acne-prone skin, washing pillowcases twice a week (not once) can make a noticeable difference. Keep 3 in rotation and swap every 3-4 days.

**3. Ventilate your home daily**
Open windows for 10-15 minutes every day, even in winter. This reduces indoor pollutants, moisture, and allergens by 50% or more. Better air quality means better health and sleep.

## Template 2: Topic Focus Edition

**Subject line:** Your shower routine needs this update

**Preview text:** 3 habits for better showers

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

This week we're focusing on shower and body hygiene. Here are the highest-voted tips:

**1. Use lukewarm water, not hot**
Hot water strips your skin's natural oils, causing dryness and irritation. Lukewarm water preserves your skin's moisture barrier. Your body gets just as clean without the damage.

**2. Dry between your toes**
Most people rush through drying, but damp feet are breeding grounds for fungus and bacteria. Take 10 extra seconds to dry completely between toes - prevents athlete's foot and foot odor.

**3. Apply moisturizer within 3 minutes**
Your skin is most absorbent right after showering while still damp. Applying moisturizer within 3 minutes locks in hydration better than waiting until you're fully dry. Proven to reduce dry, itchy skin.

## Template 3: New Content Spotlight

**Subject line:** 5 new tips just added to the wiki

**Preview text:** The latest from the community

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

The community has been busy! Here are the newest top-voted tips this week:

**1. The phone Ziploc bag hack**
Put your phone in a sealed Ziploc bag when using the bathroom. Phones carry more bacteria than toilet seats. The bag keeps your phone dry, protected, and still fully usable through the plastic. Small habit, big hygiene upgrade.

**2. Replace kitchen sponges weekly**
Studies show kitchen sponges are often the dirtiest item in homes. Replace every week, or microwave a wet sponge for 2 minutes daily to kill 99% of bacteria. Dishcloths washed daily are another great option.

**3. Don't share hair tools**
Sharing brushes, combs, and accessories spreads lice, fungi, and bacteria. Keep your hair tools personal. A small habit that prevents bigger problems.

**4. Don't douche or use feminine sprays**
These products disrupt the natural vaginal balance and increase infection risk. The vagina is self-cleaning and doesn't require internal cleaning. Less is more.

**5. Wear flip-flops in shared showers**
In gyms, hostels, or hotels, always wear flip-flops in shared showers to prevent athlete's foot and fungal infections. Quick prevention beats treatment every time.

## Template 4: Quick Wins Edition

**Subject line:** 5 hygiene habits under 30 seconds

**Preview text:** Fast tips that make a difference

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

Short on time? These 5 habits take under 30 seconds each but have real impact:

**1. Ventilate your home (10 seconds)**
Open a window. That's it. 10 seconds of airflow daily improves air quality, reduces moisture, and lowers pollutant concentration.

**2. Use a nail brush (15 seconds)**
Add a nail brush to your hand washing routine. Cleans under nails where germs accumulate. Small upgrade, big difference.

**3. Switch to a clean towel (5 seconds)**
Keep a towel rotation system. Grabbing a fresh towel is faster than dealing with musty smells or bacterial buildup.

**4. Wipe high-touch surfaces (20 seconds)**
Doorknobs, light switches, remotes. Quick daily wipe, especially during flu season or if someone is sick. Prevents germ spread.

**5. Change pillowcase (30 seconds)**
Weekly pillowcase changes prevent bacterial buildup. Keep extras in rotation so switching is quick.

Every second you invest in hygiene pays dividends in health and wellbeing.
