## Script 1: Hand Sanitizer Hack

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** You're using hand sanitizer wrong. (close up on hands)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** Most people just smear it on and call it done. But here's the thing: you need to cover ALL surfaces for 20 seconds. Between fingers, under nails, back of hands, wrists. And if your hands are dirty or greasy? Sanitizer won't work. You need soap and water. Also, make sure it's at least 60% alcohol or it's basically just scented gel.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Follow for more hygiene tips.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Cover ALL surfaces 20+ seconds

## Script 2: Face Washing Mistake

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** Stop washing your face 3 times a day. (dramatic no gesture)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** I used to think more was better, but I was stripping my skin's natural oils. My skin actually produced MORE oil to compensate. Now I wash morning and night with lukewarm water - not hot - and a gentle cleanser. No scrubbing. The difference after 2 weeks is wild. Less oil, fewer breakouts.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Try it for one week and see.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Wash 2x daily max

## Script 3: Phone Bacteria

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** Your phone is dirtier than a toilet seat. (phone close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** Then you touch it, then touch your face, transfer everything. The fix: put your phone in a Ziploc bag when you use the bathroom. Keeps it dry, protected from bacteria, and still fully usable through the plastic. Just don't forget to remove the bag before leaving.

**CTA (3 seconds):** What's your phone hygiene hack?

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Phone > Toilet seat bacteria

## Script 4: Foot Drying Tip

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** The 10-second habit that stops foot odor. (towel on feet)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** After your shower, dry your feet completely - especially between your toes. Most people rush this part. Damp feet are breeding grounds for fungus and bacteria. That's why athlete's foot and foot odor happen. Use a designated foot towel or the end of your body towel.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Your feet will thank you.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Dry between toes!

## Script 5: Toothbrush Replacement

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** When was the last time you replaced your toothbrush? (toothbrush close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** If you can't remember, it's been too long. Toothbrushes wear out after 3-4 months. Frayed bristles don't clean effectively and can damage your gums. Also, if you've been sick, replace it immediately. Your mouth deserves better than worn-out tools.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Check yours today.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Replace every 3-4 months

## Script 6: Pillowcase Hack

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** This cleared my skin in one month. (pillowcase close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** I tried expensive creams, changed my diet, saw dermatologists. The fix? Washing my pillowcases twice a week. Pillowcases accumulate dead skin, oils, bacteria, hair products, and night cream. Now I have 3 in rotation and switch every 3-4 days. The difference in my acne was surprising.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Try it for two weeks.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Wash pillowcase 2x weekly

## Script 7: Kitchen Sponges

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** Your kitchen sponge is a bacteria farm. (sponge close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** Studies show they're the dirtiest item in most homes. Here's what to do: Replace it every week. If you want to extend its life, microwave a wet sponge for 2 minutes daily - kills 99% of bacteria. Or just use dishcloths that you wash daily with your regular laundry.

**CTA (3 seconds):** When did you last replace yours?

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Replace sponge weekly

## Script 8: Bed Sheet Washing

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** You need to wash your sheets more often. (bed close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** Sheets accumulate sweat, dead skin cells, and allergens every night. If you have allergies or acne-prone skin, wash weekly. Hot water is best - kills dust mites and bacteria. At minimum? Every two weeks. Your skin and sleep quality will both improve.

**CTA (3 seconds):** When was your last wash?

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Wash sheets weekly minimum

## Script 9: Hand Drying

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** Damp hands spread more bacteria. (hands close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** After washing, dry completely with a clean towel or air dry. Moist hands transfer bacteria more easily. Avoid those hand dryers in public restrooms - they actually spread bacteria around. Paper towels are better, or bring your own small towel.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Every detail matters.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Dry hands completely

## Script 10: Nail Brush

**HOOK (first 2 seconds):** The $3 tool that upgraded my hand washing. (nail brush close-up)

**BODY (15-25 seconds):** Germs accumulate under fingernails - that's just fact. A nail brush cleans under nails during hand washing. Also keep nails trimmed short to reduce germ accumulation. 30 extra seconds, huge hygiene upgrade. Your hands will feel cleaner, and you'll spread fewer germs throughout the day.

**CTA (3 seconds):** Worth the few dollars.

**TEXT OVERLAY:** Use nail brush under nails
